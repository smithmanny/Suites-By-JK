{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I've been thinking about this project idea for a while now and finally decided to start on it. Well as of December 2, 2018, Iâ€™ve released the Beta version of <a href=\"https://devcollab.org\" target=\"_target\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dev Collab</a> ðŸŽŠ. And when I mean beta I mean more like Alpha lol, but I wanted to release this project young and watch it mature with its users. The reason I created this project was to help new programmers jump in and start working on projects with a group. Some people are afraid or just donâ€™t know where to look when it comes time finding projects to gain some experience.</p>\n<p>Currently, everything is handled with <a href=\"https://airtable.com/invite/r/ElIWUPZu\" target=\"_target\" rel=\"nofollow\">Airtable</a> in the backend, but working on converting the project to using Firebase. The reason I choose Firebase is that it just allows me to grow the project at a faster pace than setting up my own server. I like to have full control over things though so maybe in the future Iâ€™ll convert this project ðŸ¤”.</p>\n<h3>Upcoming Features</h3>\n<p>As of now, users have to click a button which opens up an Airtable form. Once the user fills out the form with their information itâ€™s then displayed on Dev Collab home page. If a user wants to modify or delete their project, they will have to contact me via Twitter and Iâ€™ll remove it for them. So with that said here are some of Dev Collab upcoming features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>User Account</li>\n<li>Link Firebase (DB/Auth)</li>\n<li>Sync Github projects </li>\n<li>Modify/Delete projects</li>\n<li>Better UI/UX design??</li>\n<li>And some moreâ€¦</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These features will start to roll out in the coming weeks so stay tuned!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Launch Of Dev Collab"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"launch-of-dev-collab"}}
